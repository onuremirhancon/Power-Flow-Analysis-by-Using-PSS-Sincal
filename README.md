# Power-Flow-Analysis-by-Using-PSS-Sincal

This project was done within the scope of EE474 Distribution Systems and Smart Grid Course in the Department of Electrical Electronics Engineering of the Middle East Techincal University.

The aim of the project is performing Power Flow Analysis of the METU Camp√ºs Power Network for a day and suggesting solutions to the problems encountered during power flow analysis.

The power flow analysis is done in the PSS Sincal Software. Load and Generation data, network topology and map of the Busses in the Metu Campus given.

First, the network is construted in the Sincal Environment, then the analysis is done.

The results can be found in the project report file
